Lob.com iOS Client
==================

Lob.com iOS Client is a simple wrapper for the [Lob.com](https://www.lob.com) API ([docs](https://www.lob.com/docs)).

### Setting Up The Project

To include the iOS Client just put the iOS Client project within the project you want to use it in. The process is outlined on Stack Overflow:

Basics
------
After including the iOS Client Project, import the Lob Library in the class where you want to use the iOS Client.

```objc
#import "LobLibrary.h"
```

Models
---------
The lob models are all in the Models folder of the iOS Client. All models are created from a dictionary.

```objc
-(LobAddressModel*)createDemoAddress {
  NSDictionary *dict = @{@"name" : @"Harry Zhang", @"email" : @"harry@lob.com",
                         @"phone" : @"5555555555", @"address_line1" : @"123 Test Street",
                         @"address_line2" : @"Unit 199", @"address_city" : @"Mountain View",
                         @"address_state" : @"CA", @"address_zip" : @"94085", @"address_country" : @"US"};
    
    LobAddressModel *addrModel = [LobAddressModel initWithDictionary:dict];
    return addrModel;
}
```

The following models are currently supported with the iOS Client.

```objc
  LobAddressModel, LobBankAccountModel, LobCheckModel, LobCountryModel
  LobJobModel, LobObjectModel, LobPackagingModel, LobPostcardModel
  LobServiceModel, LobSettingModel, LobStateModel, LobVerifyModel
```

Requests
---------
Lob requests are all found in the Requests folder of the iOS client. All requests follow a consistent naming scheme and block based return format. Lob requests should be instantiated with the api key. On list requests, the count and offset can be set as properties on the request object.

```objc
-(void)listAddresses {
  request = [[LobRequest alloc] initWithAPIKey:@""];
  [request listAddressesWithResponse:^(NSArray *addresses, NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"*** Address List Response ***");
        NSLog(@"    Addresses: %@",addresses);
    }];
}
```

The following requests are currently supported with the iOS Client.

```objc
/**
 * Address Requests
 */

-(void)listAddressesWithResponse:(void(^) (NSArray *addresses, NSError *error))response;

-(void)createAddressWithModel:(LobAddressModel*)address withResponse:(void(^) (LobAddressModel *addr, NSError *error))response;
